## AI-assistant-using-python

This Python project is an AI-powered assistant built using Streamlit for the user interface and Groq API for generating AI responses. The project uses a simple input box where users can enter prompts, which are then sent to the Groq API. The assistant leverages a specific model (llama3-8b-8192) to generate a chat completion response based on the user's input.

Key Components:

1. Streamlit: Provides an intuitive web interface where users can interact with the AI assistant by submitting prompts.
2. Groq API: Communicates with the Groq AI service to generate intelligent and relevant responses to the userâ€™s input.
3. Environment Variables: API keys are securely stored and accessed using the dotenv library to protect sensitive information.
4. LLM Model: The project uses the llama3-8b-8192 model, known for its natural language understanding and generation capabilities.


The assistant is designed to be easy to use and deploy, making it accessible to users looking for real-time AI-generated content or conversation responses.
